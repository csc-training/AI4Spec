# AI4Spec

In these tutorials exercises, we review different AI approaches to predicting
ground or excited state energy levels simply based on the atomic structure of
materials. Here we focus on molecules and molecular orbitals, but the same
principles apply to crystal structures and electronic bands.

The tutorials have been prepared by Milica TodoroviÄ‡ (University of Turku)
and Kunal Ghosh (Aalto University).

## How to run
